# odin-recipes 🫐🧁 🍌🍞
This is a complete html project (now with some css!) offered in The Odin Project titled "Recipes"

It consists of a main web page with 3 accessible dessert sections: "Crepes", "Blueberry Muffins", and "Banana Bread".

Each section provides a link to a web page revealing their description, ingredients, and steps to recreate the recipe.
